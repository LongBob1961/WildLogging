# Wild Logging

We need a quick app which will enable anyone with a phone to quickly note an animal or plant in their neighbourhood.

We want to catalog the wildlife in our urban areas
Specify a Postcode and the animal, bird, fish, tree, bush we saw
Everyone can use a website form to add a quick observation
Everyone can use a general website to see a map
