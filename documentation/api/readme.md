## Swagger API
This API defines the RESTful webservice responsible for holding 'Things' and 'Events'.  
The Things are represent species which people spot, and Events represent the time and location of where they were spotted.

The API can be tried out as read-only, by going to https://editor.swagger.io/ and uploading to the editor. 
The editor's interaction capability allows the user to send queries to the actual service it fronts.
